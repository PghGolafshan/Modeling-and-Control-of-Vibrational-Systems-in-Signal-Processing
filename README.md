# Modeling-and-Control-of-Vibrational-Systems-in-Signal-Processing
This project aims to model and control vibrational systems using signal processing techniques to optimize input vibrations and analyze output signals.
Continuous systems have infinite degrees of freedom or modes of vibration, and the displacement of each point on the beam is a combination of the displacements of all modes. However, in practice, only the first few modes are considered in modeling for simplicity.
